WARNING: Please heed the CampbBX's note:

Important: Please note that using API and Website interfaces concurrently may cause login interference issues.
Please use different external IP addresses, or pause the bot when you need to use the Web UI.

Please do not abuse the API interface with brute-forcing bots, and ensure that there is at least 500 millisecond
latency between two calls. We may revoke the API access without notice for accounts violating this requirement.
